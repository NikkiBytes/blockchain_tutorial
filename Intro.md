# Learning Blockchain

<u>**Key Terms**</u>  
- **Block:** an individual transaction or piece of data that is being stored within the blockchain.  

-  **Blockchain:** a continuously growing list ("chain") of records ("block"), called blocks, which are linked chronologically and secured using cryptography.  

## The Blockchain Network  
How does the blockchain validate transactions w/o a central authority?  

In the blockchain there are many participants in the network that are constantly checking to ensure that each transaction is valid. Each participant is a computer that owns a copy of the blockchain. The participants cross-reference their copy of the blockchain every time a new block is introduced. The validation depends on multiple participants making the digital record "decentralized".  

For a new block to be added, 51% of all participants in the blockchain network must verify that the new block is not fraudulent. Once a block has been verified as a valid transaction, it is added to each participant's copy of the blockchain.  

By having the majority of participants validate a new transaction, the blockchain removes the need for a central authority and automates the completion of transactions, reducing transaction fees while ensuring a high level of security.  

<u>**Key Terms**</u>  
- **Blockchain Network**: blockchain network and blockchain are terms used interchangeably. They represent the entire blockchain from the structure itself to the network that it is a part of.  

- **Decentralization:** the concept in which participants work together to validate transactions without relying on a central authority.  

- **Participant:** a client that owns a copy of the blockchain and verifies transactions across network.
